# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.2] — 2026-06-05

### Added

- `max_tokens` parameter on `structured_llm_call` /
  `structured_llm_call_sync`, forwarded to the provider (parity with
  `text_llm_call`). Backward-compatible; defaults to no cap. When unset
  (`None`) the outbound request is byte-identical to before — no
  `max_tokens` key is sent. `LLMCallRecord` also records the cap for log
  completeness.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-05

### Added

- Per-call `provider` override on `structured_llm_call`,
  `structured_llm_call_sync`, `text_llm_call`, and `stream_text_with_log`.
  Passing an explicit `LLMProviderInterface` (e.g. an `OpenRouterProvider`
  built from credentials) routes that single call through a different
  provider family without changing the app-wide `configure_llm_client`
  registration; `None` (the default) preserves the existing behaviour, so
  every current caller is unchanged. The invocation log records the
  provider that actually ran.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-05

Initial public release.

### Added

- Provider-agnostic call surface over LiteLLM (with `instructor` for structured
  output) across OpenRouter, Google, Anthropic, and local Ollama.
- `structured_llm_call` / `structured_llm_call_sync` — validated Pydantic output,
  with each provider pinned to its native JSON-schema mode (never auto-`Mode.TOOLS`).
- `text_llm_call` and `stream_text_with_log` for plain-text and streamed calls.
- Process-global async rate limiter (`GlobalRateLimiter`, `configure_rate_limit`).
- Transient-error retries (`with_retries`, `LLM_RECOVERABLE_ERRORS`), kept
  separate from instructor's schema-repair retries.
- Agent-readable logging: `LocalYamlLogSink` writes verdict-first per-call YAML
  plus an append-only `index.jsonl`; pluggable `LogSink` protocol for custom sinks.
- Approximate per-call cost (`approximate_cost`) sourced from LiteLLM's response
  estimate, for budget visibility.
